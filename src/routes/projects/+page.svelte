					Scraping newsrooms' styleguides
				</a>
				<br />
				I built a database of five newsrooms' styleguidesâ€” BBC, BuzzFeed, NPR, Reuters and The Guardian.
				The intention was to compare how different words and phrases are used by different publications.
				I presented the project at

				This website has gone from being a Wix project to being built on Bulma and now on SvelteKit,
				with a couple versions in between built with my own basic CSS styling. I've learnt a lot along
				the way!
