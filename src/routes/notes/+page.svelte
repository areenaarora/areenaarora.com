	<h3>2023 is the year of rage reading and visualizing history â€” specifically Indian history!</h3>

	<p>This is a work in progress!</p>
	<p>
		In the next week or so, I hope to make this table better styled, searchable and I want to be
		able to update it dynamically from a csv or json file. I will also be visualising another
		dataset about the 292 people who wrote the Indian constitution!
	</p>
	<p>Stay tuned!</p>
