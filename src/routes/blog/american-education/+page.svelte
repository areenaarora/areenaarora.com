<title>Education in America</title>

	<h1>On American public education</h1>
	<p>
		It has therefore puzzled me to see lawmakers rallying behind directing funds to private schools,
		draining public schools. There are 900,000 public school students in the state and by my
		calculation, split evenly, the $447 million voucher program could have meant nearly $500 more
		for every student enrolled in a public school in the state.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's an interesting time for public education, given the Donald Trump administration's push to
		consider dismantling the U.S. Department of Education. The agency's funds give an extra boost to
		schools with the highest levels of poverty. Those dollars could pay for social workers,
		behavioral interventionists and coaches. With states like Tennessee funneling away funds to
		private schools, taking away the source of Title I funds seems unwise.
	</p>
	<p>
		To this foreigner, focus should instead be on streamlining curriculum so it's more future-proof,
		especially when literacy skills are dipping to all-time lows, painting a bleak picture of
		education in this country. Data in the latest National Report Card showed student performance
		worsened in math and reading in 2024 testing compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, there's special education − a topic that's been the subject of many of my stories
		covering Knox County Schools. The laws in India protecting individuals with disabilities are
		bleak at best and shamefully lacking compared to the protections afforded to Americans under
		Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, yet often, as I've reported, legal protections
		aren't enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've seen inspiring moms advocate for their kids in special education, but they're faced with −
		to borrow words from the county's special education task force − "a culture of resistance" and
		retaliation. After decades of parents fighting for special education reform, the district
		announced a task force in fall of 2023 and made a public resolve to make Knox County a "model
		district for excellence in special education," but the task force hasn't met in months and at
		least one family I know has turned to homeschooling instead. One too many to be making that hard
		decision.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's another interesting one. Last year, I also wrote about concerns surrounding school safety
		and whether Knox County Schools should allow teachers and staff to carry guns, following the
		passing of a Tennessee law allowing teachers and staffers to carry concealed weapons in
		classrooms. My dad was in the Indian military and I grew up going to military schools and yet, I
		could never understand even needing a discussion on arming teachers.
	</p>
	<p>And then there are smaller differences.</p>
	<p>
		In India, schools have uniforms. In the U.S., where public education is considered the "great
		equalizer," I was often disheartened when I saw the income gap among students on full display.
		Some students wear expensive sneakers and clothing, others are in need of assistance from the
		clothing center. Back home, we all wore the same uniform and all looked the same in school.
	</p>
	<p>
		Being a reporter can sometimes hardwire your brain to see only the worst in everything. There is
		great pride in asking difficult questions and on most days, that means writing and highlighting
		wrongs in the world, but we try, too, to be present when our community celebrates.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my time here, I've seen students and teachers inspire with their sharp wit and innovative
		thinking. I've written about a foster grandparents program bringing extra hugs to students and
		about teachers at Northwest Middle School learning Spanish to better support their newest
		students who don't speak English.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've seen admirable resilience from communities who will be rebuilding their schools for years
		after the devasting Hurricane Helene. It has been truly rewarding, and hopefully someday (soon)
		I'll write a book about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Until then, I'll be watching keenly what the future holds for public education in the U.S. and
		of course more closely for Knox County and East Tennessee. To the parents and teachers who have
		trusted me with their stories, thank you − for your faith in me and for your patience as I
		navigated the complex world of American public education as an outsider.
