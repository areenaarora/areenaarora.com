	<h1>Hi! I'm Areena 🙏🏻</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a data journalist, <a
			href="https://www.instagram.com/feelin_gredient/"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer">occassional food blogger</a
		>, obsessed with talking about news media's evolution and a
		<b>🪴serious house plant enthusiast!🪴</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		I was most recently at <a

	<p>
		I'm also learning Svelte and working to improve my data visualization skills. This website is
		where I showcase my best front-end work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having studied abroad for both my bachelor's and master's, I know firsthand how complicated the
		process is and I've learned a few tricks along the way on navigating it. If you are, or know
		someone, looking to study abroad soon (particularly the U.S.), I may be able to help. Watch this
		space for some exciting announcements soon!
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm also looking for freelance opportunities in India and I'm available for commission work-
		writing, editing, data collection and analysis and data visualization!
