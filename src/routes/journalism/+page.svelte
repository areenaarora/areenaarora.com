					Straddling two worlds, UT protest leaders hold close the best of America and Palestine
				</a>
				<br />
				The Husain siblings were born in America and grew up in Knoxville, but their father is from Palestine.
				They’ve visited family in Palestine several times and each time have felt at home instantly,
				just as they do in East Tennessee, where they grew up with country neighbors whose accent sounds
				similar to them to the accent of their Palestinian cousins – if you just replace English with
				Arabic.
