Americans care about public education in a way I hadn't fully comprehended back in 2022. Americans also politicize education to an extent I couldn't have anticipated.

My husband often remarked I wrote almost equal parts about policies and politics as I did about the core tenet and purpose of education – literacy.

I grew up in India and I hadn't been to an American public school before I was assigned to the Knox News’ public education beat. Now, as I'm gearing up to move back home − Feb. 7 was my last day at Knox News − I'm reflecting on what has surprised me most.

There is no national curriculum here. Common Core standards come close, but those too aren't mandated and have not been [universally liked or accepted](https://www.k12dive.com/news/report-us-reading-math-scores-drop-after-common-core-implementation/576972/). There is also research showing how math and reading scores dropped after Common Core was implemented.

State standards differ and local communities choose their academic priorities. But, in just my short time here, though, I've seen the lines between [local priorities](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/29/knox-county-school-board-chair-testifies-for-private-school-vouchers/78020949007/) and [national political agendas](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2023/05/08/knox-county-school-board-routine-vote-echoes-national-partisan-divide/70172398007/) blur.

Curriculum in India is a lot more consistent across the country, for private and public schools alike.

For one, religion mostly [doesn't enter the equation](https://slate.com/life/2024/10/lifewise-academy-legality-ohio-parents-school-board.html) and curriculum in India is generally not at a crossroads between religion and scientific discovery. Faith is to be practiced at home.

When I first heard Tennessee's standard on sex education is abstinence, I remember thinking "surely, there's no way that could be true." It goes against the idea of a progressive, first world country to which I'd long subscribed to.

[Censorship of books](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2025/01/21/how-knox-county-schools-decided-which-books-to-remove-from-libraries/77048502007/) was another topic I never thought I'd be writing about in the land of free and brave ideas.

While I see some value in ensuring kids are exposed to age-appropriate content, the wording of recent legislation in the state is disingenuous in that regard. It instills fear in trained, professional educators, rather than promoting healthy conversations around what's appropriate and what isn't.

At a time when fourth and eighth graders still aren’t back to performing at pre-pandemic 2019 levels, the priority and focus shouldn’t be, dare I say, censorship.

All’s not doom and gloom and there are, of course, ideas I want to steal and take back home with me.

The teacher-student relationship in India is strictly academic, and teachers' involvement in students' lives is limited. Here, I see teachers devote themselves to not just educating, but also mentoring and going far above and beyond their prescribed duties.

When I see teachers here buying supplies for their classrooms and advocating before lawmakers for their schools, I'm envious of their commitment to public education. That said, I'm also confused by the lack of resources available to support public education that warrants this advocacy in the first place.

Public education in India is seen as a last-resort option, reserved for those who need it. Here, it is believed to be the backbone of the society.

It's an interesting time for public education, given the [Donald Trump-Elon Musk administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/doge-education-department-cuts-trump)'s push to consider dismantling the U.S. Department of Education.

The agency's funds give an [extra boost](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2024/07/31/knox-county-schools-alter-staffing-levels-with-federal-funding-changes/73587268007/) to schools with the highest levels of poverty. Those dollars pay for social workers, behavioral interventionists and coaches.

To this foreigner, focus should instead be on streamlining curriculum so it's more future-proof, especially when literacy skills are dipping to all-time lows, painting a bleak picture of education in this country.

Finally, there's [special education](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2024/06/06/special-education-worries-force-knox-county-family-to-homeschool/73904913007/) − a topic that's been the subject of many of my stories covering Knox County Schools.

The laws in India protecting individuals with disabilities are bleak at best and shamefully lacking compared to the protections afforded to Americans under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, yet often, as I've reported, [legal protections aren't enough](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/12/23/knox-county-schools-special-education-task-force-was-never-about-real-reform-victor-ashe-opinion/77026568007/).

I've seen inspiring moms advocate for their kids in special education, but they're faced with a culture of [resistance and retaliation](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2023/08/08/task-force-review-finds-45-deficiencies-in-districts-special-education-program/70532403007/).

To the parents and teachers who have trusted me with their stories, thank you − for your faith in me and for your patience as I navigated the complex world of American public education as an outsider.
